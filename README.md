This is my up to date portfolio, which displays an image of me and a little bit of information about me, as well as some styling with css.
There are images that will have links to future projects I will be working on.
Currently only the javascript image has a link to a html/css/javascript project.
There are links to my email and github at the bottom, and I will be adding social media links and a link to my resume.
