# My Updated Portfolio

## Description 
- This is my up to date portfolio, which displays an image of me and a little bit of information about me, as well as some styling with css.
- Below the about me section, there are images of different coding languages, and when clicked they lead to projects that I have done.
- Each project is mostly built of the language in which the image shows, but not 100% just that language of course. You can look at the github repository of that specific project to learn more about which languages were used.
- Below the work section of my portfolio there is a link to where you can email me, my github, my linkedin, and my resume.
